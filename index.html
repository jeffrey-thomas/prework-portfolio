                <h1>Background</h1>
                <strong><small>Programming as a hobby</small></strong>
                <p>
                    During college I had a difficult time deciding on a major. 
                    I spent a couple of years as a Computer science major, learning the basics of programming in C++ and Java.
                    I took enough computer science classes that I ended up with a computer science minor.
                    Despite finding programming interesting and fun I ended up deciding to be a physics teacher.

                    I think most people that become teachers value and enjoy learning. I continued to learn and make use of my 
                    interest in programming while maintaining my class website and preparing hands on activities for my students. 
                    I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make the website as easy to navigate as possible for the students. 
                    I also wrote some simple simulations for topics like wave superposition and the doppler effect that I posted on the website.
                    I also programmed small computers called Arduinos to collect data from devices such as thermocouples (temperature), 
                    photogates (time), and ultrasonic sonar devices (distance).

                <h1>Why Change?</h1>
                <strong><small>Covid and remote teaching</small></strong>
                
                <p>
                    During the pandemic the teaching profession changed drastically. While most teachers and students were back in the 
                    classroom for the 2021-2022 school year, the district I worked for decided to open an online academy and transferred me to be
                    its science teacher. This online academy used a commercial online curriculum that was already created which meant my job was 
                    mostly grading assignments from 14 different classes. I was no longer using my creativity to design and improve lessons and 
                    hands on activities and by the middle of the school year I was completely burnt out. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it became clear that I would not be able to transfer back to an in-person school in the same district I began to consider
                    other options. The idea of finding a job in another district was not appealing and I realized the last two years had killed my
                    enthusiasm for being a teacher. I have always really enjoyed programming and I had kept up with it to an extent during my years as a 
                    teacher so it seems like the perfect choice for a new career.

                <h1>Why Coding Temple?</h1>
                <strong><small>Incomplete skills</small></strong>
                <p>
                    While looking into programming jobs that I might be qualified for I noticed a few gaps in the skillset that I had developed
                    when just following my own interests. While I am confident in my HTML, CSS, and javascript abilities I have little or no experience
                    with python, databases, and server side technologies. I also realized I could use help knowing how to demonstrate the skills that 
                    I already have in a way that employers are looking for.
